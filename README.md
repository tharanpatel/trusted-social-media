# Trusted Social Media Web-app

About The Project

This is my final project for my MSc Dissertation submission - 'Development of a Social media application using novel features to enhance trust between users.' A video demonstration of this project can be found here - https://youtu.be/kNfRg5PSTj8.

Here's why:

    Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
    You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
    You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life ðŸ˜„

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the BLANK_README.md to get started.
